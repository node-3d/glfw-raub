```console
npm i -s glfw-raub
```

**Node.js** addon with **GLFW3** bindings.

![Example](examples/screenshot.jpg)

* **GLFW** version **3.4.0** backend.
* Exposes low-level **GLFW** interface.
* Multiple windows for a single **Node.js** process.
* Able to switch to fullscreen and back.
* Has `Window` class, simplifying low-level interactions.
* Has `Document` class, capable of tricking other libs, as if we are in a browser.

```js
import glfw from 'glfw-raub';
const { Window } = glfw;

const wnd = new Window({ title: 'GLFW Test', vsync: true });

wnd.loop(() => {
	if (wnd.shouldClose || wnd.getKey(glfw.KEY_ESCAPE)) {
		process.exit(0);
		return;
	}
	
	glfw.testScene(wnd.width, wnd.height);
});
```

> Note: this **addon uses N-API**, and therefore is ABI-compatible across different
Node.js versions. Addon binaries are precompiled and **there is no compilation**
step during the `npm i` command.


## GLFW

This is a low-level interface, where most of the stuff is directly reflecting
GLFW API. It **does NOT EXPOSE** OpenGL commands.
See [GLFW Docs](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html)
for useful info on what it does and doesn't.

```js
const glfw = require('glfw-raub');
```

Here `glfw` is an API container, where all `glfw*` functions are accessible as
`glfw.*`. E.g. `glfwSetWindowTitle` -> `glfw.setWindowTitle`.

See [TypeScript definitions](/index.d.ts) for more details.

----------


### class Window

```js
const { Window } = require('glfw-raub');
```

This class helps managing window objects and their events. It can also switch between
fullscreen, borderless and windowed modes.

See [TypeScript definitions](/index.d.ts) for more details.

----------

### class Document

```js
const { Document } = require('glfw-raub');
```

It can be used to facilitate the environment for other
JS libraries, such as [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

See [TypeScript definitions](/index.d.ts) for more details.
